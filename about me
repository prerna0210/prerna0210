As a final-year Computer Science and Engineering student at Vellore Institute of Technology, I am passionate about data analytics, web development, and cloud technologies. My hands-on experience with tools like SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and cloud platforms such as AWS and Google Cloud enables me to develop data-driven solutions that drive business growth.

During my internships at Finlatics and Unified Mentor, I optimized SQL queries, created interactive dashboards, and automated data processes, all while collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver actionable insights. My projects, including a hotel booking web application and a heart disease prediction site, demonstrate my ability to apply technical skills in real-world scenarios.

With a strong foundation in analytics and software development, I am eager to contribute to innovative projects and leverage my skills to solve complex problems in dynamic environments. I am actively seeking opportunities to grow in the fields of data analytics and software engineering.
